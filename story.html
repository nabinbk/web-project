    <h1>BRING IT BACK TOMORROW</h1>
    <p>
        A customer walked into the post office wanting to mail a package. “Two-day shipping will cost $12.95 to get it
        there by Friday,” my coworker Billy told her. The customer, clearly looking to save a few bucks, said, “The
        package doesn’t have to get there till Saturday. Is there any way to make that happen?” Billy nodded. “Sure. You
        can bring it back tomorrow.”
